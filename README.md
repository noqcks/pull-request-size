Pull Request Size is a GitHub App that applies `size/*` labels to Pull Requests based on the total lines of code changed (additions and deletions).

Pull Request Size calculates the size of a PR as

```
total additions + total deletions - (all generatedÂ¹ file additions/deletions)
```

Â¹ A generated file is either one of the standard generated files as defined in [noqcks/generated](https://github.com/noqcks/generated/blob/master/lib/generated.js) or defined with `linguist-generated=true` in a `.gitattributes` file.


## Configuration

This app requires no configuration out of the box. However, you can exclude certain files
from being counted towards a PR's size, and you can add custom labels in Github.
### Excluding Files

If you have files that you would not like to be included in the calculation for a Pull Request's size, you can modify the `.gitattributes` file with the flag `linguist-generated=true` on your file or file pattern.

For example to mark all `.meta` files as generated, add this line to `.gitattributes`

```
*.meta linguist-generated=true
```

A `.gitattributes` file uses the same rules for matching as `.gitignore` files. See [GitHub documenation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github) on the linguist-generated flag for more info.


### Custom Labels

You can set custom label names and colors by checking in the file `.github/labels.yml` to every repository you'd like to customize

```
XS:
  name: size/XS
  lines: 0
  color: 3CBF00
S:
  name: size/S
  lines: 10
  color: 5D9801
M:
  name: size/M
  lines: 30
  color: 7F7203
L:
  name: size/L
  lines: 100
  color: A14C05
XL:
  name: size/XL
  lines: 500
  color: C32607
XXL:
  name: size/XXL
  lines: 1000
  color: E50009
```
